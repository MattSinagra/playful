# Playful

Welcome to playful, a (starter?) WordPress theme that combines Webpack 4(wpack.io), Timber & Composer. The intention behind this theme is to be a starting point for a more modern theme development.

In its current state you can use it to build out a pretty standard Twig/Timber theme, but the intention will be to make theme that will be near 100% Gutenberg blocks.

### The Good
    - Theme works :)
    - Support for ES8
    - Bootstrap is already rolled in

### The Bad
    - No template files or partials have been included, but if you are using this you should know what you are doing
    - Gutenberg Blocks - None have been implemented at this point because I am trying to figure out a nice way to handle them via WP CLI
